# From: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42962571/what-is-the-difference-between-skip-build-and-test-without-building-on-fastlane
# The skip_build parameter will omit the build command from the generated xcodebuild command that ultimately gets executed by scan.
# This means that if there is a built product in DerivedData, it will use it instead of recompiling your app.
# If there is no build product in DerivedData, it will rebuild the product.
